Qs: Given a paragraph, find the top_n words excluding the stopwords.
with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        # read the file and split it into words
        words = file.read().lower().split()
        
        # remove stopwords from the list of words
        words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]
        
        # count the frequency of each word
        word_counts = Counter(words)
        
        # return the top n most frequent words
        return word_counts.most_common(n)
