Qs: Longest substring in palindrome:
text='madam'
longest_subs=''
for i in range(0,len(text)):
  for j in range(i+1,len(text)+1):
    substring = text[i:j]
    if substring == substring[::-1] and len(substring)>len(longest_subs):
      longest_subs = substring

Qs: Suppose we are given an array of n integers which represent the value of some stock over  time. Assuming you are allowed to buy the stock exactly once and sell the stock once, what is  the maximum profit you can make? Can you write an algorithm that takes in an array of  values and returns the maximum profit? 
For example, if you are given the following array: 
[2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 14, 25, 14, 0, 4, 5]


1 def version1_SellProfit(n): 
2 max_profit = 0; 
3 for i in range(0, len(n)): 
4 for j in range (i + 1, len(n)): 
5 max_profit = max(max_profit, n[j] - n[i]) 
6 
7 return max_profit

Qs: Given a paragraph, find the top_n words excluding the stopwords.
with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        # read the file and split it into words
        words = file.read().lower().split()
        
        # remove stopwords from the list of words
        words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]
        
        # count the frequency of each word
        word_counts = Counter(words)
        
        # return the top n most frequent words
        return word_counts.most_common(n)


Qs: i have a dataframe df, one col is quantity, i want to filter data where quantity is greater than avg of quantity

# Create example DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'quantity': [3, 5, 8, 2, 4, 9, 1, 6, 7]})

# Calculate the average quantity
avg_quantity = df['quantity'].mean()

# Filter the DataFrame where quantity is greater than the average quantity
filtered_df = df[df['quantity'] > avg_quantity]

# Print the filtered DataFrame
print(filtered_df)
